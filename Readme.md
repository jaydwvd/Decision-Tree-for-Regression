 Problem Statement : Decision Trees for Regression

For this question, use this dataset to try and predict gas consumptions (in millions of gallons) in 48 US states based upon gas tax (in cents), per capita income (dollars), paved highways (in miles) and the proportion of population with a drivers license.

Use Decision Trees to build a regressor for the give data. Use Grid Search to find the optimal value for the hyperparameters, and evaluate your model on the appropriate metrics.
